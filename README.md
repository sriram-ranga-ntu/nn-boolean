This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used for the experiments done in the paper "Learnability of Boolean Function Properties".

Notebooks and their contents are:

1. Hadamard from Walsh Spectrum.ipynb - a simple neural network model developed to learn the Walsh spectrum of Boolean functions and consequently to predict their non-linearity.
2. Correlation Immunity from Walsh Spectrum.ipynb - neurons which learn to act as logical gates that find out if a Boolean function is 1-CI given its Walsh spectrum.
