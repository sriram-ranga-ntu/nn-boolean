# Learnability of Boolean Function Properties

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used for the experiments done in the paper "Learnability of Nonlinearity of Boolean Functions - An Experimentation with Neural Networks" and some additional experiments.

Notebooks and their contents are:

1. Hadamard from Walsh Spectrum.ipynb - a simple neural network model developed to learn the Walsh spectrum of Boolean functions and consequently to predict their non-linearity.

2. nl_end_to_end.ipynb - an encoder style neural network that learns nonlinearity in an end to end manner. Works form 4 and 5 variable functions.

4. Correlation Immunity from Walsh Spectrum.ipynb - neurons which learn to act as logical gates that find out if a Boolean function is 1-CI given its Walsh spectrum.
